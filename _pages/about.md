Hi there! I like to use computers for problem-solving and hopefully make tools which can assist others. 

I am a software engineer at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/). Prior to this I completed my undergraduate degrees in [Metallurgical and Materials Engineering](https://mme.iitm.ac.in/) and [Computational Engineering](https://ioe.iitm.ac.in/program/computational-engineering/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) (2017-22).

I was associated with [Dr. Satyesh K. Yadav's group](https://home.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/) at IIT Madras where I worked on first-principles atomistic modelling of electrode materials and metal-ceramic interfaces. The work on metal-ceramic interfaces entailed the development of neural-network interatomic potentials due to the enormous size of the simulations. This association provided unparallel exposure for an undergraduate to the domain of computational materials science, tools like Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) and VESTA, and the use of AI in materials science.

At Cisco, the journey has been a tremendous learning experience. I am working with cloud-based microservice architecture while fulfilling few roles. The roles vary from designing and improving analytical pipelines, and scripting APIs for the consumer services of these pipelines to maintaining and upgrading the components in the computing environment. (Maintenance and upgrade activities can be slightly mundane if the fixes are straightforward. I enjoy debugging. :smiley:) In addition to these roles, I contribute to the development of features and infrastructure related to observability stack.

Outside my working hours, I am assisting Dr. Satyesh K. Yadav's group and [Center for Atomistic Modelling and Materials Designing (CAMMD)](https://ioe.iitm.ac.in/project/atomistic-modelling-and-materials-designing/) with the development of a materials database.

Other than computers, I like to read -- usually mystery and science fiction -- with few scattered attempts at writing. I love a good sudoku puzzle. ([Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrackingTheCryptic) and [Logic Masters Germany](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/?chlang=en) are two ingenious collection of sudoku puzzles.) On that note, I have been documenting sudoku puzzles which had fun but challenging solution. [Take a look if sudokus intrigue you!](https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Benutzer/allgemein.php?name=pothepanda)
