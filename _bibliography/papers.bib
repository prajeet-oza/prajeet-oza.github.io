  abstract = {Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we separate the distortion energy (DE) on Fe due to the introduction of solute atoms like B, C, N, and O at different sites from the electronic binding energy (EBE) of a solute atom with Fe. Contrary to the belief that distortion energy alone dictates the preference of solute atoms for a site in bulk, we show that EBE dictates the preference of the O for the octahedral site in Fe, with DE being the highest at the site. The site preference for C and N in bulk Fe is dictated by both DE and EBE. However, DE alone dictates site preference for B. The DE of solute atoms cannot be predicted by calculated radius, which is highest for B and lowest for O. We find that O and B have similar distortion energy due to large charge transfer to the O atom from Fe.}

  abstract = {Interface by definition is two-dimensional (2-D) as it separates 2 phases with an abrupt change in structure and chemistry across the interface. The interface between a metal and its nitride is expected to be atomically sharp, as chemical gradation would require the creation of N vacancies in nitrides and N interstitials in metal. Contrary to this belief, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we establish that the chemically graded Ti/TiN interface is thermodynamically preferred over the sharp interface. DFT calculated N vacancy formation energy in TiN is 2.4 eV, and N interstitial in Ti is −3.8 eV. Thus, diffusion of N from TiN to Ti by the formation of N vacancy in TiN and N interstitial in Ti would reduce the internal energy of the Ti–TiN heterostructure. Diffusion of N is thermodynamically favorable till ∼23% of N has diffused from TiN to Ti, resulting in an atomically chemically graded interface, which we refer to as a 3-D interface. We show gradual variation in lattice parameters and mechanical properties across the Ti/TiN interface. This opens a new way to control properties of metal/ceramic heterostructures, in line with the already established advantage of gradation at interfaces in micrometer length scale.}

  abstract = {NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, large-scale synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3 with a robust microstructure favoring enhanced sodium-ion storage, which is crucial for commercial usage as an electrode for SIBs, is still illusive. In this work, in situ carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (C-NVP) nanoparticles embedded in a three-dimensional mesoporous carbon matrix has been prepared by the scalable microwave-assisted sol–gel route. It delivers stable specific capacities of ∼112 and ∼102 mA h g–1 at 0.1 and 1 C-rates (1 C = 118 mA g–1), respectively, in the potential window of 2.3–3.9 V versus Na/Na+. In a wider potential window of 1.2–3.9 V, C-NVP shows reversible insertion/extraction of ∼2.4 moles of Na+ ions corresponding to a specific capacity of ∼143 mA h g–1, with 75\% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1.0 C-rate. We attribute such unusual stability at higher moles of Na+-ion insertion to the ability of nanocrystallites to freely expand against mesoporous carbon as Na3V2(PO4)3 converts to Na4V2(PO4)3. Moreover, a symmetric full cell using C-NVP as both cathode and anode shows excellent cyclability and rate performance, with a high specific capacity of 50 mA h g–1 at 2 A g–1 stable for >10,000 cycles, corresponding to specific energy and power density of 88 W h kg–1 and 3504 W kg–1, respectively. A proto-type pouch cell (symmetric full cell) delivers 7 mA h capacity at 0.1 A g–1. The scalable microwave-assisted sol–gel route provides a robust solution for the large-scale synthesis of C-NVP with superior sodium-ion storage performance.}
